# assemblyAutomation
Objective was to code an automation so that a solenoid is moved from position A to position B

The purpose of this station is the positioning of the base shell of the rotation mechanism in the transfer pallet.
 
The transfer pallet arrives at station A, a catch stops it and sends a confirmation signal.
 
The positioning process is initiated on pressing start and on receiving confirmation that the shell is on the feeder belt.
 
The base shell is deposited on a conveyor belt which serves as a feeder.  The belt stores several base shells which have been placed on it manually.
 
The positioning of the base shell on the pallet is done by a manipulator with two shafts.  A horizontal shaft and a vertical shaft with pneumatic action.
 
The horizontal shaft supports the vertical shaft which has pincers with a wide opening attached to the end.  The action of the pincers is pneumatic.
 
Once the positioning of the base shell on the pallet has been completed, the manipulator returns to its initial position, the stop catch releases the pallet and this moves towards station B, positioning the bearing.
